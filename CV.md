| 2013 - 2022 | Werkgroep VissenOnderzoek Friesland     | The aim of this working group is to improve knowledge of the distribution of freshwater fish in the province of Friesland and to support a better protection. Being an active member for nine years and one of two coordinators for three years, I gained extensive experience with researching freshwater fish using various methods. Next to that, I organized many excursions to keep distribution data updated and to educate adults and children about the unknown flora and fauna that lives below the water surface. My contribution to this working group is one of the reasons that I was awarded the Youth Lenders Award by the NGO RAVON. |
| 2016 - 2019 | Study association Students for Wildlife | This study association at the Van Hall Larenstein University of applied sciences regularly organizes excursions and presentations about the wild flora and fauna of the Netherlands. In a team of around seven students, I was a general coordinator for two years and chairman for one year. During my chairmanship, one of the most successful activities was the on-campus Bioblitz. With the help of species experts, students, and citizens, we were able to record 431 species in the area, and even more people were reached thanks to the local media attention.                                                                             |
| 2015 & 2018 | Potmarge Amfibieën Doelgroep            | As coordinator and volunteer of this amphibian migration road crossing project, I contributed to the safe migration of Amphibians in the city of Leeuwarden. Being a coordinator in a team of four, I was responsible for the coordination of the volunteers that helped the amphibians cross the road every morning and evening. I also gave practicals about amphibians and aquatic animals to high school classes of the local school and children living in the neighborhood.                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 2016 - 2018 | Idylle Waadhoeke                        | In 2016, the Butterfly Association of the Netherlands awarded a €10.000 prize to the best citizen initiative to create a local wild butterfly garden. I made an agreement with the municipality of Franeker, my hometown, that they would provide an area of 2 hectares if I could win the contest. I gathered a group of citizens, a primary school, and a gardening business that were willing to participate, and after presenting our plan to the Butterfly Association, we won the prize, and the butterfly garden was realized. Nowadays it is a popular place for the citizens of Franeker to visit.                                          |
